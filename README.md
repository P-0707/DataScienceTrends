# **Exploring Global Trends in Data Science Careers: A Data Analysis and Visualization Project**

<br>

## **Overview**

This project analyzes global trends in data science careers, focusing on factors like salary, company size, experience level, and remote work policies. <br>
Using a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, we explored insights into how these factors impact compensation, work flexibility, and career progression. <br>
The project involved data processing in Python, visualization in Power BI, and culminates in an interactive dashboard. <br>

## **Project Objectives**

- Examine how company size, experience level, and location influence salaries in data science. <br>
- Analyze remote work trends and the impact of company structure on work flexibility. <br>
- Visualize key insights and trends with an interactive Power BI dashboard. <br>
- Provide actionable recommendations for both data science professionals and employers. <br>

## **Dataset**

**Source:** Kaggle - [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yusufdelikkaya/datascience-salaries-2024) <br>
**Description:** This dataset contains anonymized job information for data science roles, sourced from surveys, job postings, and public records. <br>
It includes key variables such as salary, currency, experience level, company size, remote ratio, and geographical location. <br>

## **Data Processing and Visualization Techniques**

### **Data Cleaning:**

- Removal of duplicates and handling of missing values. <br>
- Standardization of currencies and calculation of remote work ratios for consistency. <br>

### **Data Enrichment:**

- Conversion of salaries to USD for cross-country comparison. <br>
- Calculation of remote work flexibility across different company sizes and experience levels. <br>

### **Visualization Tools:**

- **Python:** Data processing and initial analysis. <br>
- **Power BI:** Visualization and creation of an interactive dashboard. <br>

## **Key Visualizations:**

- Salary distribution by experience level, company size, and geography. <br>
- Remote work ratios segmented by company size and experience level. <br>
- Geographical heatmaps to show global distribution and salary disparities. <br>

## **Power BI Dashboard**

The Power BI dashboard provides an interactive exploration of data science employment trends, with sections on: <br>

### **Salary Distribution**

Highlights average and maximum salaries across experience levels and company sizes. <br>

### **Remote Work Trends**

Displays variations in remote work policies by company size and experience level. <br>

### **Geographical Insights**

A heatmap showing salary trends by employee residence and company location. <br>

### **User Interactivity**

Includes filters and slicers for work year, experience level, and employment type to enable custom analysis. <br>

## **Key Findings**

### **Experience Level and Salary**

Clear salary progression, with experienced professionals earning the highest salaries. <br>

### **Company Size and Remote Work**

Small companies provide more remote work flexibility, while large companies offer higher average salaries. <br>

### **Geographical Disparities**

The U.S. has the highest concentration of data science roles, with significant salary differences across countries. <br>

### **Remote Work Trends**

A trimodal distribution in remote work ratios (0%, 50%, 100%) reflects a mix of in-office, hybrid, and fully remote work setups. <br>

## **Recommendations**

### **For Employers**

Structure competitive salaries based on experience and provide flexible remote work options to attract top talent. <br>

### **For Data Science Professionals**

Use these insights for career planning, salary negotiation, and understanding the impact of company size and location on compensation. <br>

## **Future Exploration**

Potential studies could focus on industry-specific trends and the impact of long-term remote work on salary structures. <br>
