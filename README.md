**Exploring Global Trends in Data Science Careers: A Data Analysis and Visualization Project**


**Overview**

This project analyzes global trends in data science careers, focusing on factors like salary, company size, experience level, and remote work policies. Using a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, we explored insights into how these factors impact compensation, work flexibility, and career progression. The project involved data processing in Python, visualization in Power BI, and culminates in an interactive dashboard.


**Project Objectives**

Examine how company size, experience level, and location influence salaries in data science.

Analyze remote work trends and the impact of company structure on work flexibility.

Visualize key insights and trends with an interactive Power BI dashboard.

Provide actionable recommendations for both data science professionals and employers.


**Dataset**

Source: Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yusufdelikkaya/datascience-salaries-2024

**Description:** This dataset contains anonymized job information for data science roles, sourced from surveys, job postings, and public records. It includes key variables such as salary, currency, experience level, company size, remote ratio, and geographical location.


**Data Processing and Visualization Techniques**

**Data Cleaning:**

Removal of duplicates and handling of missing values.

Standardization of currencies and calculation of remote work ratios for consistency.

**Data Enrichment:**

Conversion of salaries to USD for cross-country comparison.

Calculation of remote work flexibility across different company sizes and experience levels.

**Visualization Tools:**

Python: Data processing and initial analysis.

Power BI: Visualization and creation of an interactive dashboard.

**Key Visualizations:**

Salary distribution by experience level, company size, and geography.
Remote work ratios segmented by company size and experience level.
Geographical heatmaps to show global distribution and salary disparities.



**Power BI Dashboard**

The Power BI dashboard provides an interactive exploration of data science employment trends, with sections on:

**Salary Distribution**: Highlights average and maximum salaries across experience levels and company sizes.

**Remote Work Trends**: Displays variations in remote work policies by company size and experience level.

**Geographical Insights**: A heatmap showing salary trends by employee residence and company location.

**User Interactivity**: Includes filters and slicers for work year, experience level, and employment type to enable custom analysis.


**Key Findings**

**Experience Level and Salary**: Clear salary progression, with experienced professionals earning the highest salaries.

**Company Size and Remote Work**: Small companies provide more remote work flexibility, while large companies offer higher average salaries.

**Geographical Disparities**: The U.S. has the highest concentration of data science roles, with significant salary differences across countries.

**Remote Work Trends**: A trimodal distribution in remote work ratios (0%, 50%, 100%) reflects a mix of in-office, hybrid, and fully remote work setups.


**Recommendations**

**For Employers**: Structure competitive salaries based on experience and provide flexible remote work options to attract top talent.

**For Data Science Professionals**: Use these insights for career planning, salary negotiation, and understanding the impact of company size and location on compensation.

**Future Exploration**: Potential studies could focus on industry-specific trends and the impact of long-term remote work on salary structures.
